1,'7/7 The obvious response is why not just optimize the real measure and not the proxy one\, but this is generally impossible since we usually can\'t translate what we care about into a single number\, and definitely not one that we can measure.'
1,'6/7 Algorithmic systems are a "double edged sword" in that they can optimize very quickly and so are very "efficient" in optimizing whatever proxy measure they are aiming for. We\'ve already seen this in the 2010 "Flash Crash" and it\'s likely to happen more.'
1,'5/7 In human / social system we often add regulations as "regularizations" - ways to inject inefficiencies into the system so as to prevent over optimization. E.g.\, rent control stops converting all apartments into luxury ones in boom times\, which will then be empty in recessions'

1,'2/7 The strong version is that at some point optimizing P will become *negatively* correlated with O. In machine learning we call this "over fitting". There are special (but important!) cases where over-fitting is benign\, as in @jaschad\'s plot or https://t.co/koQLtCpHVv but ..'
1,'Great post! My thoughts below:

Goodhart\'s law is "when a measure becomes a target\, it ceases to be a good measure"
